# Cappy Auth

This web app handles authentication and user/control server coordination for our capstone project.
It does so by providing a REST API that uses JSON to communicate with the control sevrers and frontend.

## API

The API implements limited CRUD functionality for Users, Sessions, and Control Servers.
All error responses (>= `400`) return the failing error class and message to the client.
This should help when debugging requests.

### Users

This resource implements the create, update, and destroy actions for a user.
Also, this resource contains an action to associate a user with a control server and to get the currently logged in user.
All paths are namespaced under `/auth/users`.

#### Get the currently logged in user

* Method: `GET`
* Path: `/auth/users/logged_in`
* Response Codes:
  * 200 - User was found
  * 404 - No user logged in
